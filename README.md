# hierarchical_clustering project
# Project Title: Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of American mall market called as phonix mall,find out on the basis of clients requirements of dendrograms using scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy",to ace the no of linkage of the clustering to predict.
# Problem Statement:
1.The American Finance market clients as per the rate for the GDP of 2011 found as highest no of growth in their business market.

2.As data science engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future

# TASK:
1.with the help of scipy library import the library and import datasets.

2.using the dendogram to find the optimal no of clusters.

3.create the hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplot libery

# Conclusion:
According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster no 3 as give highest no of linkage.
